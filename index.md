Lisa Schibelius
======
Lisa is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Engineering Education at Virginia Tech after working in the aerospace industry for 4+ years with Airbus Americas Engineering. She has experience in project management, aircraft upgrades, and process automation as an engineer in airworthiness & certification and retrofit of aircraft cabins in Upgrade Services. Her background includes a B.S. and M.S degree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in aerospace engineering from the University of South Alabama. She aspires to use her connections from industry to bridge the gap between engineering education and industry needs, while helping students in their own personal development to become creative problem-solvers and well-rounded, global engineers. She has teaching and mentoring experience from introductory robotics with elementary students, flight dynamics and mentoring for middle-schoolers, and graduate teaching assistantships for foundations of engineering for first-year students, Global STEM Practice: Leadership and Culture with the Rising Sophomore Abroad Program (RSAP) at VT, and thermal science with senior-level mechanical engineering students.

Research interests
======
academia-industry alignment, global engineering, cultural awareness,  sustainable engineering, art and creativity in engineering (but her research interests continue to evolve and expand).
